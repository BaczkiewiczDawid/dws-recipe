        name: 'Spaghetti Carbonara',
        level: 'medium',
        ingredients: ['Egg', 'Salt', 'Pepper', 'Pasta', 'Bacon'],
        preparation: `Boil the pasta al dente in salted water. Scald the eggs with boiling water, add them to a deep plate, season with salt and beat with a fork.
        Put the diced bacon into the pan and fry it over low heat for a few minutes until it is lightly browned. Add grated garlic and chopped parsley and fry for a dozen more seconds.
        Keeping the pan over low heat, add the pasta and mix. Set aside from the heat, add half the cheese and season with freshly ground pepper.
        Pour over the pasta with beaten eggs and mix. Eggs must not be completely cut, they are to create a creamy sauce and only thicken a little from the hot pasta.`,

        preparation: `Make a leaven from warm milk, yeast, sugar and a tablespoon of flour and leave to rise in a warm place for about 10 minutes. Add the leaven, water and salt to the flour and gradually add the melted butter while kneading. Knead the dough (by hand, in a bread machine or with a robot) until the dough is elastic and smooth.`,

        name: 'Omlette',
        level: 'easy',
        ingredients: ['Egg', 'Butter', 'Oil'],
        preparation: `beat the eggs into a deep plate, add salt and milk. Meanwhile, heat up the pan with the butter. Beat the eggs with a fork (for about a dozen seconds), making vigorous circular movements with your hand, thus forcing air into the mass.
        Pour over the melted butter and fry for about half a minute until it starts to thin from the bottom, then use the spatula to move the mass from the edges towards the center of the pan, pouring the raw mass into the free place, turning the pan at the same time. When the bottom is completely cut and the center remains slightly moist, fold the omelette in half and place it on a plate.`,
